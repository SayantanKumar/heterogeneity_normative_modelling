## Datasets & Feature extraction

### Datasets

Our analysis included a discovery dataset consisting of individuals from ADNI and a replication dataset consisting of individuals from Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center (ADRC) dataset at Washington University in St. Louis.

ADNI data used in this study are publicly available and can be requested following ADNI Data Sharing and Publications Committee guidelines: [https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/). Knight ADRC data can be obtained by submitting a data request through [https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/data-request-form/](https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/data-request-form/).
